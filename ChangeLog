* src/domain_expander.c (_check_ender): Added a free call after the substr
call, which was causing a memory leak.
(_inner_expand): Same as above.

* src/Makefile (LDFLAGS): Added -ldl. Since there is an issue with ld's
--as-needed flag, I've turned on --no-as-needed, to ensure libdl gets linked.
Thanks for this goes to git, for using a util that wasn't linked against
libdl.

* src/domain_expander.c (expand_domain): added a check to see if c is null,
since they can really pass us any ole' garbage, and a null call will result in
a segfault. Should be fixed now. Thanks to some half-baked app for finding
this out.
